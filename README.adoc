= 🛠️ AutoGeo

*The complete geospatial toolbox.*

AutoGeo is a modern alternative of Charles Ghilani's "ADJUST" software package that is used in conjunction with his textbook _Adjustment Computations_.

It improves upon ADJUST by bringing documentation and context to the data entry page, thereby maintaining the flow of user experience.

It also provides a more modern and intuitive user interface, and a more robust and flexible backend.
